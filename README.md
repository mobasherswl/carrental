This is like a training project which provides an opportunity to learn & enhance coding, design, technical, tool / technology related & problem solving skills. It is a simple project which mimics a car rental business. It is divided into 4 indenpendent components for better management and simplicity. Parent project contains only the parent POM whereas the common project contains DTOs & functionality common between server & client application. The client is writting in swing for now. The client / server communication is done via Spring HttpInvoker but can easily be replaced or exposed via other ways like REST etc.
